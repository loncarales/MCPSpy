# MCPSpy Project Rules

## Project Overview

MCPSpy is a CLI utility that uses eBPF to monitor MCP (Model Context Protocol) communication by tracking stdio operations and analyzing JSON-RPC 2.0 messages.

## Technology Stack

- Go 1.24+ for the main application
- C for eBPF programs
- cilium/ebpf for loading eBPF programs
- Docker for containerization

## Architecture

MCPSpy uses an event-driven architecture with a publish-subscribe pattern:

- **Event Bus (`pkg/bus/`)**: Central communication hub that decouples components
- Components communicate by publishing and subscribing to typed events
- The eBPF loader publishes raw events from kernel space
- The HTTP session manager and MCP parser subscribe to relevant events
- Output handlers subscribe to parsed MCP messages

## MCP Protocol Context

- MCP uses JSON-RPC 2.0 format
- Messages have jsonrpc: "2.0" field
- Three message types: Request, Response, Notification
- Track method names like "tools/call", "resources/read", etc.
- Focus on both stdio and HTTP transport (streamable HTTP).

## Performance Guidelines

- Use efficient data structures
- Minimize data copying between kernel and userspace
- Filter early in eBPF to reduce overhead
- Event bus uses asynchronous processing to avoid blocking

## Building

```bash
make build
```

## Running

```bash
# Run with TUI mode (default)
sudo ./mcpspy

# Run with static console output (for testing/debugging)
sudo ./mcpspy --tui=false

# It is must be stopped by sending SIGINT (Ctrl+C) or SIGTERM.
# In TUI mode, you can also press 'q' to quit.
```

## Testing

Running all tests (unit tests, and end-to-end tests for both stdio and https transports):

```bash
make test
```

Running unit tests:

```bash
make test-unit
```

Running end-to-end tests (including mcpspy, and verifying the output):

```bash
make test-e2e-stdio
make test-e2e-https

# Or
make test-e2e
```

Running solely the mcp e2e tests (without mcpspy):

```bash
make test-e2e-mcp-stdio
make test-e2e-mcp-https
make test-e2e-mcp-security  # Security/injection test
```

**Note:** E2E tests automatically run MCPSpy in static mode (`--tui=false`) to capture output for validation. The test configuration is in `tests/e2e_config.yaml`.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests verify functionality with real external services. Currently includes security/prompt injection detection tests with HuggingFace API:

```bash
# Run all integration tests (requires HF_TOKEN)
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx make test-integration

# Run only security integration tests
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx make test-integration-security

# Override the model (default: protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2)
HF_TOKEN=hf_xxx HF_MODEL=meta-llama/Llama-Prompt-Guard-2-86M make test-integration
```

**Test structure:**

- `pkg/security/testdata/samples.json` - Test samples (benign and malicious)
- `pkg/security/hf/integration_test.go` - HF client integration tests
- `pkg/security/integration_test.go` - Full analyzer integration tests with event bus

**Notes:**

- Integration tests use build tag `//go:build integration`
- Default model is `protectai/deberta-v3-base-prompt-injection-v2` (non-gated)
- Unit tests run without API calls via mock HTTP server

## Git Worktrees for Parallel Claude Sessions

Use worktrees to run multiple Claude sessions on separate feature branches.
Use the .worktrees/ directory to keep things organized in terms of permissions:

```bash
# Create worktree with new branch
git worktree add .worktrees/MCPSpy-<feature> -b feat/<feature-name>

# Work in the new directory
cd .worktrees/MCPSpy-<feature> && claude

# Cleanup after merge
git worktree remove .worktrees/MCPSpy-<feature>
```
