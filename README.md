<b>MCPSpy - Real-time monitoring for Model Context Protocol communication using eBPF</b>
</div>

## Overview

MCPSpy is a powerful command-line tool that leverages [eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter)](https://ebpf.io/) technology to monitor [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) communication at the kernel level. It provides real-time visibility into JSON-RPC 2.0 messages exchanged between MCP clients and servers by hooking into low-level system calls.

The Model Context Protocol supports three transport protocols for communication:

- **Stdio**: Communication over standard input/output streams
- **Streamable HTTP**: Direct HTTP request/response communication with server-sent events
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: HTTP-based streaming communication (_Deprecated_)

**MCPSpy supports monitoring of both Stdio and HTTP/HTTPS transports** (including Server-Sent Events), providing comprehensive coverage of MCP communication channels.

## Why MCPSpy?

The Model Context Protocol is becoming the standard for AI tool integration, but understanding what's happening under the hood can be challenging. MCPSpy addresses this by providing:

- **🔒 Security Analysis**: Monitor what data is being transmitted, detect PII leakage, and audit tool executions
- **🐛 Debugging**: Troubleshoot MCP integrations by seeing the actual message flow
- **📊 Performance Monitoring**: Track message patterns and identify bottlenecks
- **🔍 Compliance**: Ensure MCP communications meet regulatory requirements
- **🎓 Learning**: Understand how MCP works by observing real communications

# Add Go to PATH (add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile for persistence)
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Option 2: Install via snap

```bash
sudo snap install go --classic
```

#### Build MCPSpy

Clone the repository and build MCPSpy:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alex-ilgayev/mcpspy.git
cd mcpspy

# Build the project
make all
```

### Docker

```bash
# Build Docker image

### Kubernetes

MCPSpy can be deployed in Kubernetes clusters to monitor MCP traffic from AI/LLM services like LangFlow, LangGraph, and other applications that use the Model Context Protocol.

```bash
# Deploy MCPSpy as a DaemonSet
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alex-ilgayev/mcpspy/main/deploy/kubernetes/mcpspy.yaml
```

#### Real-World Use Cases in Kubernetes

1. **Monitoring LangFlow/LangGraph Deployments**

   - Observe MCP traffic between LangFlow/LangGraph and AI services
   - Debug integration issues in complex AI workflows
   - Audit AI interactions for security and compliance

2. **AI Service Monitoring**

   - Track interactions with both remote and local MCP servers
   - Identify performance bottlenecks in AI service calls
   - Detect potential data leakage in AI communications

3. **Development and Testing**
   - Test MCP implementations in containerized environments
   - Validate AI service integrations before production deployment
   - Ensure consistent behavior across different environments

For detailed instructions and real-world examples of monitoring AI services in Kubernetes, see the [Kubernetes Usage Guide](docs/kubernetes-usage.md).

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start monitoring MCP communication
sudo mcpspy

# Start monitoring with raw message buffers
sudo mcpspy -b

# Start monitoring and save output to JSONL file
sudo mcpspy -o output.jsonl

# Stop monitoring with Ctrl+C
```

### Output Format

}
```

## Architecture

MCPSpy uses an event-driven architecture with a publish-subscribe pattern to decouple components and enable extensibility. The system consists of several components that communicate through a central event bus:

### 1. Event Bus (`pkg/bus/`)

- Central communication hub using publish-subscribe pattern
- Enables asynchronous event processing
- Using `github.com/asaskevich/EventBus` library

### 2. eBPF Program (`bpf/`)

- Hooks into `vfs_read` and `vfs_write` kernel functions for stdio transport
- Hooks into TLS library functions (`SSL_read`, `SSL_write`) for HTTP/HTTPS transport
- Filters potential MCP traffic by detecting JSON patterns
- Sends events to userspace via ring buffer
- Minimal performance impact with early filtering

### 3. eBPF Loader (`pkg/ebpf/`)

- Manages the lifecycle of eBPF programs and resources
- Loads pre-compiled eBPF objects into the kernel using cilium/ebpf library
- Converts raw binary events from kernel space into structured Go data types
- Publishes events to the event bus for downstream processing

### 4. HTTP Session Manager (`pkg/http/`)

- Subscribes to TLS-related events from the event bus
- Manages HTTP/HTTPS sessions and correlates request/response pairs
- Handles TLS payload interception and parsing
- Supports chunked transfer encoding and Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Reconstructs complete HTTP messages from fragmented TLS data
- Publishes reconstructed HTTP bodies to the event bus for MCP parsing

### 5. MCP Protocol Parser (`pkg/mcp/`)

- Subscribes to data events from the event bus (stdio and HTTP TLS payloads)
- Validates JSON-RPC 2.0 message format
- Parses MCP-specific methods and parameters
- Correlates read operations and write operations into a single MCP message (relevant for stdio transport)
- Supports both stdio and HTTP/HTTPS transports (including SSE)
- Publishes parsed MCP messages to the event bus

### 6. Output Handlers (`pkg/output/`)

- Subscribe to MCP message events from the event bus
- Console display with colored, formatted output
- JSONL output for programmatic analysis
- Real-time statistics tracking

### 7. Event Logger (`pkg/eventlogger/`)

- Subscribes to all events on the event bus for debugging
- Provides detailed logging of event flow through the system
- Configurable log levels for different event types

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Generate eBPF bindings and build
make all

# Build Docker image
make image
```

### Testing

MCPSpy includes comprehensive end-to-end tests that simulate real MCP communication across different transports:

```bash
# (Optional) Set up test environment
make test-e2e-setup

# Run all tests (requires root privileges)
make test-e2e

# Run individual transport tests
make test-e2e-stdio   # Test stdio transport
make test-e2e-https   # Test HTTP/HTTPS transport
```

The test suite includes:

- MCP server and client simulators for both stdio and HTTP transports
- Message validation against expected outputs
- Multiple message type coverage
- SSL/TLS encrypted HTTP communication testing

## Limitations

- **FS Events Buffer Size**: Limited to 16KB per message. This means MCP messages with **buffer size** greater than 16KB will be missed / ignored.
- **FS Events Constructed of Multiple Messages**: MCPSpy currently does not support reconstructing MCP messages that are split across multiple `read` or `write` syscalls. This means that if an MCP message is larger than the buffer size used in a single syscall, it may be missed or ignored.
- **Inode Collision for Stdio Transport**: Inode numbers are only unique within a filesystem. If monitoring processes across multiple filesystems or mount namespaces, inode collisions are theoretically possible but rare in practice for pipe-based stdio communication.
- **Platform**: Linux only (kernel 5.15+).
